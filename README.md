TODO
====

* Make some way to preview chapters for different characters
* Really wait until everything is loaded before showing the "Start" button

Later
-----

* Redesign chapter editing page (show previous chapter's text & actions)
* Allow narrators to change password, and create more narrators
* Maybe add an "admin" role so that not all narrators can create users?
* Show background information or whatever to players (add fields for
  description (public) and backstory (private))

Initial narrator
----------------

The initial user/narrator is "narrator", and the password is "changeme!".
