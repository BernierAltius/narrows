TODO
====

* Check mobile widths and such
* Change the play/pause icons to a musical note, or maybe a speaker
* Prevent players from reading unpublished fragments
* Really wait until everything is loaded before showing the "Start" button

Later
-----
* Allow narrators to change password, and create more narrators
* Maybe add an "admin" role to that not all narrators can create users?
* Show background information or whatever to players
* Add some shitty buttons for now for the mentions
* Add some place for players to write notes

Initial narrator
----------------
The initial user/narrator is "narrator", and the password is "changeme!".
