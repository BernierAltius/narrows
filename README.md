TODO
====

* Allow writing messages as narrator
* Redesign chapter editing and/or make a chapter commandeering page
* Make some way to preview chapters for different characters
* Really wait until everything is loaded before showing the "Start" button
* Character reference (with short description) inside chapters?
* Add fields for description (public) and backstory (private)

Later
-----

* Why does Opera for Android not start the music when it's on, and
  effectively inverts the audio toggle functionality??
* Allow narrators to change password, and create more narrators
* Maybe add an "admin" role so that not all narrators can create users?
* Show background information or whatever to players

Initial narrator
----------------

The initial user/narrator is "narrator", and the password is "changeme!".
