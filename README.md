TODO
====

* Add interface for the mentions
* Add image selector in the editor (to add and upload images)
* Add e-mail notifications
* Make sure reactions are also fetched on the first screen of chapter
  creation
  * Bah, not so easy
  * Reactions are taken for a chapter, maybe they should be taken for
    a list of participants and an optional cut-off publishing date?
* Show background information or whatever to players
* Allow narrators to change password, and create more narrators
* Really wait until everything is loaded before showing the "Start" button
* Maybe add an "admin" role so that not all narrators can create users?

Initial narrator
----------------

The initial user/narrator is "narrator", and the password is "changeme!".
