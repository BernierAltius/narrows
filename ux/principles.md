# Design principles

* As immersive as possible:
  * Heavily focused on the story
  * Easy to add images and audio
  * As little visible UI as possible when reading
  * Focused on (short) chapters, not on sentences or paragraphs
* As seamless as possible for readers/players:
  * Should not require creating an account
  * URLs in e-mail notifications must not require login
* Narrators are in charge of all the text:
  * All the narration text is written by the narrator (to keep continuity and same style)
  * Players can send messages to one another and to the narrator, but
    they are separate from the "canonical" text
  * It should be possible for characters to keep secrets from each other
* It should work for busy players:
  * The heavy lifting should be done by the narrator
  * A pace of once-a-week should work fine
* Allow the narrator to split the action:
  * Not all chapters should be for all characters
  * Should be possible to mark certain parts of a chapter to be read by only certain characters

Explicitly, it's **not** among the principles to bring a regular
table-top RPG session online. An online, text-based, asynchronous
narration has very different dynamics than a face-to-face RPG session,
and thus it should be different.
